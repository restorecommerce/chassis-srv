= Command Interface

The generic command interface allows querying information from and triggering actions on microservices.
Commands are usually used for administrative or operational concerns and should not be used for actions
triggered by ordinary users. There are common commands but also such that are only understood by individual services.
The command interface supports the following communication patterns:

* Fire-and-forget
* Request-reply

Technically, the command interface is described by the `Command` endpoint.
This endpoint is available as https://grpc.io/docs/[gRPC] interface and event-driven communication through Kafka.
Request and response message structures are defined using https://developers.google.com/protocol-buffers/[Protocol Buffers]
in the https://github.com/restorecommerce/protos/blob/master/io/restorecommerce/commandinterface.proto[commandinterface.proto] file.
Due to the high variability among all command possible parametes, the `payload` field is defined as a `google.protobuf.Any` message
(see https://github.com/restorecommerce/protos/tree/master/google/protobuf[google] protos), as well as all gRPC response messages.
The `CommandResponse` message is mainly used on Kafka events, as it contains a `services` field, which identifies all services bound to a specific microservice.

The following common system commands are available (also see below):

* health_check (microservice health check)
* restore (re-process https://kafka.apache.org/[Apache Kafka] event messages to restore system data)
* reset (reset system data and state)
* version (return runtime version information)
* set_api_key (sets api key on microservices)
* config_update (update configuration on microservices)

Unimplemented:

* reconfigure (reload configurations for one or more microservices)

Note that the provided implementation's commands can be extended or even overriden when it is partially or totally
incompatible with a service's context. It is also straightforward to include new commands by extending the given
link:../../../../src/command-interface/index.ts[CommandInterface] class.

== Common Commands

=== HealthCheck

This command allows to retrieve a healt status for a service (note that a restorecommerce microservice may have several
service names bound to it).

Possible `payload` fields in a request:

|===
|Field |Type |Label |Description

|service |string |required |name of the service to be checked
|===

Possible fields in a response:

|===
|Field |Type |Label |Description

|status |string |required |serving status; it can be `SERVING`, `NOT_SERVING` and `UNKNOWN`
|===

=== Restore

This command allows to restore the state of an implementing service, as well as all data managed by that service.
The default implementation checks the configuration files for all DB instances bound to the implementing service
and maps a set of Kafka events to a set of CRUD operations.
These Kafka events are emitted by the service every time a resource is created/ modified in the store.
The same events are processed from a Kafka consumer offset in order to restore all data since a previous a point in time.

*Note*: this event processing can only be done in the correct order with single partitioned-topics,
as Kafka ensures offset order per-partition.

Possible `payload` fields in a request:

|===
|Field |Type |Label |Description

|data |[ ]RestoreData |required |list of topics for message re-processing
|===

`RestoreData`

|===
|Field |Type |Label |Description

|entity |string |required |The resource's entity name
|base_offset |number |optional |Base offset at which to start the restore process; default is `0`
|ignore_offset |[ ]number |optional |Topic offset values to ignore while restoring
|===

=== Reset

This allows to wipe all data owned by a microservice.
The `chassis-srv` default implementation only supports the chassis ArangoDB database provider as a valid provider.
When `reset` is called, each of the specified resource's DB is truncated. There are no specific parameters either
for the request payload and for the response.

=== Version

This command returns the NPM package and Node.js version of the implementing service.

Response fields:

|===
|Field |Type |Label |Description

|version |string |required |NPM package version
|nodejs |string |required |Node.js version
|===

=== SetApiKey

This command `set_api_key` sets the `authentication:apiKey` on the microservices, the configuration to set the API Key is provided
in the payload of the command. This API Key is used by the https://github.com/restorecommerce/acs-client[`acs-client`]
to override access control checks for https://github.com/restorecommerce/acs-client[`access-control-srv`].

=== ConfigUpdate

This command `config_update` sets the provided configuration on the microservices. The configuration to be set is provided in the
payload of the command.

== Usage

See link:../../../../test/command_test.ts[tests].
